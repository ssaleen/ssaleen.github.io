      Hi, I'm Saleen, a second year Computer Engineering student at the 
      <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a>.
      I enjoy learning about all things technology, programming, and electronics!
      If you don't like that stuff, I also love soccer, F1, and basketball!
